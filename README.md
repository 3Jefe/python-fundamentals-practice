# Python Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains a collection of short Python exercises I completed to
strengthen my programming fundamentals.

The scripts cover:

- Variables and basic data types
- Lists, dictionaries and loops
- Functions and simple error handling
- Working with files
- Basic object-oriented programming

These examples are based on exercises from my Computer Science modules and
self-study practice.
